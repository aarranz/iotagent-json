## Description
This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge between an MQTT/HTTP+JSON based protocol and the FIWARE NGSI standard used in FIWARE.
This project is based in the Node.js IoT Agent library. More information about the IoT Agents can be found in its 
[Github page](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).

A quick way to get started is to read the [Step by step Manual](./docs/stepbystep.md).

As is the case in any IoT Agent, this one follows the interaction model defined in the [Node.js IoT Agent Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib),
that is used for the implementation of the Northbound APIs. Information about the IoTAgent's architecture can be found
on that global repository. This documentation will only address those features and characteristics that are particular
to the JSON IoTAgent.

If you want to contribute to the project, check out the [Development section](#development) and the [Contribution guidelines](./docs/contribution.md).

Additional information about operating the component can be found in the [Operations: logs and alarms](docs/operations.md) document.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). Check also the [FIWARE Catalogue entry for the IoTAgents](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-management-idas)

## Build & Install

Information about how to install the JSON IoTAgent can be found at the corresponding section of the [Installation & Administration Guide](docs/installationguide.md).

## API Overview

An Overview of the API can be found in the [User & Programmers Manual](docs/usermanual.md).

## API Reference Documentation

Apiary reference for the Configuration API can be found [here](http://docs.telefonicaiotiotagents.apiary.io/#).
More information about IoTAgents and their APIs can be found in the IoTAgent Library [here](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).

## Command Line Client 
The JSON IoT Agent comes with a client that can be used to test its features, simulating a device. The client can be 
executed with the following command:
```
bin/iotaJsonTester.js
```
This will show a prompt where commands can be issued to the MQTT broker. For a list of the currently available commands
type `help`.

The client loads a global configuration used for all the commands, containing the host and port of the MQTT broker and
the API Key and Device ID of the device to simulate. This information can be changed with the `config` command.

In order to use any of the MQTT commands, you have to connect to the MQTT broker first. If no connection is available,
MQTT commands will show an error message reminding you to connect.

The Command Line Client gets its default values from a config file in the root of the project: `client-config.js`. This
config file can be used to permanently tune the MQTT broker parameters, or the default device ID and APIKey.

## Testing

[Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) Test Runner + [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) Assertion Library + [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) Spies, stubs.

The test environment is preconfigured to run [BDD](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) testing style with
`chai.expect` and `chai.should()` available globally while executing tests, as well as the [Sinon-Chai](http://chaijs.com/plugins/sinon-chai) plugin.

Module mocking during testing can be done with [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire)

#### Requirements

All the tests are designed to test end to end scenarios, and there are some requirements for its current execution:
- Mosquitto v1.3.5 server running
- MongoDB v3.x server running

#### Execution

To run tests, type
```bash
grunt test
```

Tests reports can be used together with Jenkins to monitor project quality metrics by means of TAP or XUnit plugins.
To generate TAP report in `report/test/unit_tests.tap`, type
```bash
grunt test-report
```

##  Development documentation

Information about developing for the JSON IoTAgent can be found at the corresponding section of the [User & Programmers Guide](docs/usermanual.md).
